Write your debugging steps and thought process here (This is part of your grade)

* First, scan the entire project to find any 'new' keywords and take note of their location(s).

* Add initial bullet points of each file to be debugged, add tabbed bullet points in each file's section for each fix.
  
* Inventory.h: 

	* Made an Inventory() destructor.
	
	* Deleted newed nSize variable at the end of the Print() method in Inventory.h

	* Made a loop in the Inventory destructor to delete all newed Items from m_Items after printing.

* Item.h / Item.cpp:

	* Used delete on the extra m_Value variable assignment in the Item() constructor. No need to create the same variable twice in a row...
	
	* Made an Item() destructor in Item.h and Item.cpp (declared in .h, defined in .cpp).

	* Added a delete m_Value command inside the Item destructor.

	* Deleted newed value variable at the end of the Print() method in Item.cpp

* ScopeMain.cpp:
	
	* Deleted the newed variable 's'

* Store.h / Store.cpp:
	
	* Deleted newed variable 'helperItem'

	* Made a destructor for the Store class (declared in .h defined in .cpp)

	* Added a delete[] m_Inventories line inside the Store destructor.
